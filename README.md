## Project Title

"Self-Portrait Website"
A digital reflection of my personal and professional life.

## Description

This project is a self-portrait creatively represented as a website. Through this webpage, I share small insights into my life, including:

My journey as a student and designer.
My hobbies, such as running, yoga, and traveling.
Highlights from my portfolio, showcasing a small part of my design work.
Visuals and videos from my travels, offering a closer look into the experiences that inspire me.

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive, personal, and engaging perspective into who I am while demonstrating my web design skills.

## Technologies Used

This website is built primarily using:

HTML: To structure the content of the webpage.
CSS: To style and bring the design to life.
I focused on HTML and CSS as these are the technologies Iâ€™m most comfortable and experienced with. While I have some familiarity with JavaScript, this project emphasizes my strengths in HTML and CSS.
