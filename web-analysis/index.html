    <h1>Outstanding Webs</h1>

    <p>For this task, we had to select one web project per awarder from among the nominees and honored ones, and write a brief explanation for each including an analysis and reasons for considering it an outstanding web design. </p>
    <p> From a coding bootcamp to a Parisian hotel, I found four amazing websites.</p>

    <!-- First analysis -->
    <h3>Analysis 1: NOD Coding</h3>
<p>URL of the nominees: <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/websites/nominees/" target="_blank">https://www.awwwards.com/websites/nominees/</a></p>
   <p>URL of the analyzed website: <a href="https://nodcoding.com/" target="_blank">https://nodcoding.com/</a></p>
    <p>I believe this web design is outstanding for several reasons.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Color palette: The color palette creates their brand identity, it is harmonious and I feel at ease with pastel colors. </li>
        <li>Imagery: Regarding imagery and graphics, what caught my attention to begin with is the animation in the homepage and that with the mouse of the computer, you can move it as well if you hover on the animation. I think this is innovative and interactive. I also liked the way they wrote “Coding” with shapes rather than with letters. </li>
        <li>User experience: It is easy for users to find what they're looking for and from the very first glance at the website it is understandable what it is about which is a bootcamp for coding. </li>
        <li> It is a responsive website and when the viewport gets smaller, the menu turns into a hamburger menu. Finally, when you hover over the menu (not the hamburger one), there's an animation which I've never seen before and I would love to incorporate it into my web even though I have no idea how to do it. </li>
    </ul>
 <!-- Adding the images below the lists -->
 <div>
    <img src="images/coding.png" alt="Image 1" width="400" height="220" style="margin-bottom: 30px; inline-block; margin-right: 20px;">
    <img src="images/coding2.png" alt="Image 2" width="300" height="220" style="margin-bottom: 30px; inline-block; margin-right: 20px;">
    <img src="images/coding3.png" alt="Image 3" width="300" height="220" style="margin-bottom: 30px; inline-block; margin-right: 20px;">
</div>


  
    <!-- Second analysis -->
    <h3>Analysis 2: Bowery Farming</h3>
   <p>URL of the nominees: 
    <a href="https://winners.webbyawards.com/winners/websites-and-mobile-sites/general-desktop-mobile-sites/food-drink" target="_blank"> https://winners.webbyawards.com/winners/websites-and-mobile-sites/general-desktop-mobile-sites/food-drink 
    </a>
</p>
    <p>URL of the analyzed website: <a href="https://bowery.co/" target="_blank">https://bowery.co/</a></p>
    <p>This website is innovative, trendy, and visually appealing.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Animations: From the start, there's an animation that leads up to the homepage which I've never seen before so I found it surprising in a good way. Throughout the page, there are animations (that are interactive), good quality photographs and illustrations which makes it more visually appealing, especially since the website is about food but I will say it took me a few minutes to understand what the website is about.  </li>
        <li>Typography: They use several fonts which go well with each other and they use different weights; from bold to thinner ones. The one I liked the most is the bold one as it caught my attention multiple times. </li>
        <li>Placement and menu: I like how their logo is placed in the middle of the header and how when the viewport gets smaller, the menu turns into a hamburger menu (which is trendy). </li>
        <li>Menu: While scrolling, the menu is not fixed. Instead, it turns into a button which I don't think I've seen before so I found it innovative. Overall, I liked the user experience because it was fun, creative and it invited you to keep learning about the website.  </li>
    </ul>

    <div>  <img src="images/farm1.png" alt="Image 1" width="400" height="220" style="margin-bottom: 30px; inline-block; margin-right: 20px;">
        <img src="images/farm2.png" alt="Image 2" width="400" height="220" style="margin-bottom: 30px; inline-block; margin-right: 20px;">
        <img src="images/farm3.png" alt="Image 3"  width="400" height="220" style="margin-bottom: 30px; inline-block; margin-right: 20px;"> 
    </div>

    <!-- Third analysis -->
    <h3>Analysis 3: Firefly Partners</h3>
 <p>URL of the nominees: <a href="https://thefwa.com/awards/page/3" target="_blank">https://thefwa.com/awards/page/3</a></p>
    <p>URL of the analyzed website: <a href="https://fireflypartners.com/" target="_blank">https://fireflypartners.com/</a></p>
    <p>The website features strong branding through its color palette and carousel elements.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Color palette: The first thing that caught my attention was the color palette since it includes a saturated orange, yellow and purple. I believe these colors work very well. </li>
        <li>Photographs: What I also liked are the photographs they are using; they help transmit their objective very well and they function as examples of their work. </li>
        <li>Carousels: Moreover, throughout the site there are three carousels of information (which I don't see very often in web design) and I believe it is a good way of making the page more interactive or making the user interested in the information you are providing. </li>
        <li>Typography: Font pairing is also well done in this page and I believe it keeps the website interesting and visually appealing. I think the only thing I disliked is that the header doesn't occupy the whole viewport. </li>
    </ul>

     <div>  <img src="images/firefly1.png" alt="Image 1" width="400" height="220" style="margin-bottom: 30px; inline-block; margin-right: 20px;">

        <img src="images/firefly3.png" alt="Image 3"  width="400" height="220" style="margin-bottom: 30px; inline-block; margin-right: 20px;"> 
    </div>

    <!-- Fourth analysis -->
    <h3>Analysis 4: Place Vendome</h3>
  <p>URL of the nominees: <a href="https://www.cssdesignawards.com/wotd-award-winners" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.cssdesignawards.com/wotd-award-winners</a></p>
   <p>URL of the analyzed website: <a href="https://www.1-placevendome.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.1-placevendome.com/en/</a></p>
    <p>This is an innovative website that uses horizontal scrolling which creates a unique experience.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Scrolling: In Place Vendome, you can scroll from right to left and from top to bottom. I think this is very innovative but for some people it may be hard to use or you may get lost quite easily. What helps in this case is that there is a button called “Room collection” on the left upper corner which allows you to see the rooms in a list. </li>
        <li>Quotes: As you move around, the homepage, quotes start appearing which is also something I've never seen before. Most of them I found quite random as they're not related to the hotel or to the hospitality environment but still I found them surprising in a good way. </li>
        <li>Photographs: The website shows the different rooms the hotel has in a unique way, they use good quality photographs but more interestingly, they showcase the photos and animated illustrations like a moodboard. This works great, at least for me, because the user gets to have a glimpse of how it would feel to stay in each room and they get to choose the one they like the most. </li>
        <li>Parisian feeling: From the showcased photos to typography and color, the web design reflects that Parisian feeling. Overall, it is a classy web design that found a way to be innovative but still elegant and interesting. </li>
    </ul>
